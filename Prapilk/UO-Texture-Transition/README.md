Hi everyone,

To make life easier for everyone and so I don’t have to explain how to do it anymore :D, I managed to create this program. A heads-up for programmers... you might bleed from your eyes :D. However, if you extract the textures from UOFIDDLER, you’ll get the correct IDs for the BrushID right away. The Alphas also need to be named A_DL1, A_DR1, etc., and B_DL2, etc. I had to rack my brain a bit over this... but at least you only have to do it once. There’s a folder with alphas and another with textures on the GitHub so you can test it out. This allows you to have the Type in the XML; the rest is pretty straightforward.
